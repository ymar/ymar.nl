I built this web app to explore my own Spotify listening habits in more detail. Using the Spotify API, it shows your top tracks and artists over different time periods, along with detailed audio features of your favorite songs.

The app is built with Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components for a clean, modern interface. I particularly enjoyed working with the Spotify API and discovering patterns in my own listening behavior.
