It's been a while since I've done one of these "Recently" posts, so I thought I'd take a moment to capture what's been occupying my time and thoughts lately.

## Work

I've been settling into my role as a Managing Consultant at Brite, where I'm leading Salesforce implementations for clients across various industries. It's been exciting to dive deep into complex CRM strategies and guide cross-functional teams towards innovative solutions.

## Reading

I've been on a bit of a non-fiction kick lately:

- "The Pragmatic Programmer" by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt - A classic that I'm revisiting. It's amazing how much of this advice remains relevant two decades later.
- "Atomic Habits" by James Clear - I'm always looking for ways to optimize my routines, and this book has provided some valuable insights.
- "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim - A novel about IT, DevOps, and business management that's surprisingly engaging.
- "Never Enough" by Andrew Wilkinson - An insightful exploration of ambition, success, and the pursuit of "enough" in the context of entrepreneurship and life satisfaction.

## Listening

My love for melodic house music continues, I've been particularly enjoying:

- Colorscapes Volume 6
- DJ Kicks by Disclosure
- Cascade by Floating Points
- Desire by Dosem

## Learning

- Diving deeper into Salesforce Data Cloud 
- Expanding my knowledge of Salesforce Marketing Cloud


## Watching

- "KAOS" (Netflix) - A modern take on Greek mythology with a dark, comedic twist.
- "Industry" Season 3 (HBO) - Continuing to follow the high-stakes world of international finance with its intense character dynamics.
