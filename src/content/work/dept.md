As Salesforce CRM Team Lead at DEPT®, I spearheaded high-impact Salesforce implementations for enterprise clients. My leadership centered on developing CRM strategies that tangibly improved customer satisfaction and retention rates. 

I led cross-functional teams to deliver tailored Salesforce solutions that directly addressed client KPIs. This involved architecting scalable systems that integrated seamlessly with existing tech stacks, ensuring minimal disruption to ongoing operations.

My expertise lay in translating complex client requirements into actionable Salesforce configurations, always with an eye on enhancing the end-user experience.

Aditionally my goal is to elevate DEPT®️'s position as a strategic partner, ensuring sustainable growth in the competitive digital landscape.
