As a Mendix Developer and Consultant at Daywize, I specialized in enhancing user experiences through custom application development. Leveraging the latest version of Mendix, I created intuitive and responsive interfaces by utilizing advanced HTML and CSS coding techniques. My role involved collaborating closely with peer developers and sales consultants to understand the client's specific needs and translating them into user-centric solutions.
